# Quick Start

Install required add-ons:

- MQTT broker e.g. [Mosquitto](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/mosquitto/DOCS.md)
- [Homeassistant MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) to enable discovering the MQTT devices and entities
- Configure
  - Clients(Modbus Hubs/USB to Serial Converters) and Servers(Devices/RTUs) See Configuration section for details.
  - MQTT host, port, username and password

# Configuration

## Server

Each server should be defined as

```
  - name: "SG1"
    serialnum: "A2340700442"
    server_type: "SUNGROW_INVERTER"
    connected_client: "Client1"
    modbus_id: 1
```

- `name` is used to create the HA entity unique_id, and device name. Use alphanumeric characters only. Keep it unique.
- `serialnum` is verified upon add-on startup.
- `server_type` is used to select the class of server to instantiate. This add-on supports SUNGROW_INVERTER, SUNGROW_METER and SUNGROW_LOGGER.
- `connected_client` specifies on which client bus (abstraction of serial port or tcp ip) the server is connected. Most systems use a single client.
- `modbus_id`: Modbus slave address of the device/server.

### Sungrow Meter

The sungrow meter has 3 additional parameters:

- `pt_ratio`: the voltage transformer ratio (int)
- `ct_ratio`: the current transformer ratio (int)
- `meter_reverse_connection`: a flag used to indicate if the ct was connected in reverse. Swops import and export registers and multiplies power values by -1. (bool)

All three values can be found from the logger web UI at Device Monitoring > Select Meter Device > Initial Parameters.

## Client

Each client should be defined as

```
  - name: "ModbusTCP"
    type: "TCP"
    host: "10.0.0.15"
    port: 502
```

or

```
  - name: "ModbusTCP"
    ha_display_name: "Client2"
    type: "RTU"
    port: "/dev/tty1"
    baudrate: 9600
    bytesize: 8
    parity: false
    stopbits: 1
```

- `name` see Server config above
- `type` can be one of "RTU" or "TCP"
- `port` is the com port if `type` is "RTU", TCP port if `type` is "TCP"

# Writing
Writing is not guarenteed to succeed. Under the default configuration, 3 attempts are made for a write, whereavfter it is aborted. 
Note that writing is often invalid. E.g. when certain registers are disabled in the device settings. 

# Use with CoCT SCADA
When used in conjunction with the Voyanti CoCT SCADA addon, production constraints and ramping can be controlled remotely, and real-time generation values can be reported. 

- Designed for use with one or more inverters, connected to a Sungrow Logger. 

To ensure proper working of the scada system, 
1. Set Power Regulation to Remote Control Mode, with open loop control in the Sungrow Logger web interface.
2. Configure the CoCT with the topics of the relevant states and commands required as stated in its docs.
3. Start/Restart this addon, followed by the CoCT scade addon. This will set all production constraints, and ramp constraints to 100% or 100%/min.

# Development

## Running locally

`devcontainer.json` can be used in vs code (Rebuild and reopen in container), followed by the task start Home assistant from `tasks.json` as outlined [here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/testing/).

`run_locally.sh` starts the app with default configuration, and creates a temporary local mosquitto broker

`run_tests.sh` runs all python unit test after setting the appropriate environment variables

Both make use of a spoofClient class which returns fake readings.

## Tests

- Completed tests
  - loader
  - some app functionality
- TODO tests
  - rest of app functionality
  - server
  - client
  - modbus_mqtt

### Defining a new Server type (for new add-on)

Abstract class Server in `server.py` can be implemented. See abstractmethod docstrings for information.

Add the new type to the enum in `implemented_servers.py` and use this string when declaring the `server_type` in config.yaml
