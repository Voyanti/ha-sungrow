# Changelog

## 0.5.2

### Fixed
- Unrecoverable reconnect loop after the device closed the TCP connection: the stale socket was never closed, so every retry reused it and only a manual addon restart recovered. Connection errors now force a fresh socket and retry once before escalating.
- Modbus timeouts (slow device) no longer tear down the transport; they get one in-place retry before escalating, preventing availability flapping and serial-port churn on RTU.
- Reconnect attempts to offline devices are paced by a 30s cooldown instead of retrying every loop.
- MQTT discovery is republished when a server reconnects, so devices that were offline at addon startup now get their Home Assistant entities.
- A failed reconnect during the retry sweep can no longer crash the addon; the addon also starts (and keeps retrying) when all devices are offline at boot.
- Modbus access is serialised between the read loop and the MQTT command thread.
